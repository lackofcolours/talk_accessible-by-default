							<li>have tried using only a keyboard to navigate and use a feature you’ve built</li>
							<li>have any kind of experience, making or consuming an accessibility audit report</li>
							<li>have tried using a desktop screen reader like JAWs, NVDA, or OS X VoiceOver</li>
							<li>have watched an assistive tech user, be it 
								<ul>
									<li>screen reader user</li>
									<li>400% zoom user</li>
									<li>braille display user</li>
									<li>Windows high contrast mode user</li>
									<li>or others, use your featur</li>
								</ul>

							If your answer to any of the last 3 questions was ‘no’... let me ask you again,<br>
							Who thinks they have <strong>truly implemented an accessible feature</strong>?

						<p>Not even the whole product, just a feature?</p>

					<p span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						Inclusion and access to <br><strong>information</strong> 
						and <strong>services</strong>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I love digital.govt.nz‘s explanation:</p>
						<p>Web accessibility is about inclusion — making sure everyone, including disabled people and those using assistive technologies, can access online information and services.</p>
						<p>So what this is saying, people need to be able to access and use the web. </p>
						<p>Why is it important that everyone have access? Because</p>
						<p><storng>Information</storng> leads to knowledge. Knowledge empowers to people</p>
						<p>What about <storng>services</storng>? Services enable users to achieve their goal</p>

					<h2>How is <br>web = accessible?</h2>
					
					<p span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						<strong>Hyper Text Markup Language</strong><br>
						🤍  HTML
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>How were these information and services made accessible?</p>
						<p>By using declarative programming languages like Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</p>
						<p>HTML is a way to give meaning to text content!</p>
						<p>Why is HTML accessible?</p>
						<p>Being a declarative language by nature, it was designed to be mostly backward compatible, and simpler to use for developers/content creators.</p>
						<p>It’s also standardised so any browser can interpret and render it...</p>
						<p>Yes, even your smart fridge’s browser.</p>
						<p>It might not know how to render JavaScript or even Cascading Style Sheets, but it sure knows how to render HTML.</p>

					<h2>Who is web accessibility for?</h2>
					
					<p span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						🤍  Everyone
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Who’s all this work for?</p>
						<p>If you’ve been listening, or have used the internet lately, that’s technically everyone.</p>
						<hr>
						<p>It IS the purpose of the web. Well coded products with HTML, CSS, and JS enable users to access web content.</p>
						<p>If the web was coded in a non-standard way, our laptops, phone, and smart toaster browser will not be able to render the content for us to consume well. </p>
						<p>It slightly disables or hinders our ability to use the web.</p>
						<p>But meaningless HTML, hiding content via CSS, and blocking JS can be especially <strong>disabling for the disabled communities</strong>.</p>

					<h2>
						“Disabled”<br>
						communities
					</h2>
					
					<p span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						Permanent, temporary, situational
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When I started learning about disability, I was so scared of referring to someone as “disabled”. </p>
						<p>Is that an offensive way to refer to a group?</p>
						<p>But after talking to advocates, reading user stories, and watching demos, I realised no, “disabled people” is exactly what we should be using.</p>
						<p>It’s <strong>social model of disability</strong>, which is especially relevant when us creators create things for people to use.</p>
						<hr>
						<ul>
							<li>A <strong>blind</strong> person can be disabled from using a site that isn’t well designed for screen readers.</li>
							<li>A <strong>wheel chair rider</strong> post hip surgery can be disabled by narrow groceries self checkout.</li>
							<li>A person <strong>cooking with dirty hands</strong> could be disabled from using recipe software if it doesn’t allow for voice dictation.</li>
							<li>A person with <strong>severe ADHD</strong> was disabled from finding product information, because of heavy use of distracting looping animations in the marketing site.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In all of these usage of the term “disabled”, you’ll notice that it’s how the technologies have been designed that disbled and barred users with different access needs from helping themselves. </p>
						<p>By not considering, or designing with these users, design stops these communities from becoming independent.</p>
						<p>It is the creators saying: <strong>The problem is with you, not the tool</strong>.</p>
						<p>Wow, what a way to create an inclusive world.</p>
						<p>It’s especially scary to think about, when anyone can become ‘disabled’ at any point in their lives.</p>

						<p>So, how do these people with access needs consume the web? </p>
						<p>They use assistive technologies!</p>
						<hr>
						<p>There are many many types of assistive technologies to serve people with <strong>different access needs</strong>.</p>
						<p>A disabled user may adopt different strategies to access content, which could use a variety of tools. </p>
						<p>Example of the most common tools out there:</p>

						<p>1. Glasses</p>
						<p>Oh yes, what I’m wearing now is an assistive tech. </p>
						<p>In fact, one of the most common and oldest forms still in use today!</p>
						<p>I wear it so that I can read content without the aid of other people. </p>
						<p>Useful for working out if I need to say hi to someone walking towards me.</p>
						<p>Now, lets move a little closer to other tech which helps users in the digital era.</p>

						<p>2. Screen Magnification</p>
						<p>No, not just Control + to zoom into different apps or documents.</p>
						<p>But the whole computer could be zoomed in. </p>
						<p>Users with low or tunnel vision, need to be able to consistently view the whole computer in predictable ways. Page reflows when you just zoom into specific app don't really help with that.</p>
						<p>And marvel at how some multi column apps just aren’t usable this way. </p>
						<p>Remember that content writing guideline of no more than 8-12 sentences in one line? </p>
						<p>Yeah, these users especially need that to happen. </p>
						<p>And single column layout with all important functions on the left for L-to-R language speakers. </p>
						<p>Wow single column layout has never been so important.</p>

						<p>3. High contrast mode</p>
						<p>What it says on the tin. </p>
						<p>This is how the users who struggle with shades of grey designs use to cope. </p>
						<p>Since they’ve felt they can’t rely on the site creators to provide an accessible colour palette for them.</p>
						<p>This means the colours could be inverted automatically. Images without contrast alternatives could blur into the background.</p>

						<p>4. Refreshable Braille display</p>
						<p>Watching someone use one of these was so magical. </p>
						<p>A deaf and blind user can plug these braille displays into their computer or phone, and it translate what screen readers read out into braille!</p>
						<p>A lot of these readers have amazing shortcuts. Advance users can type whole paragraphs purely with a couple of keystrokes!!!</p>
						<p>Since we know almost definitely that braille users can’t see, it’s more important than ever to make sure everything has a text description, and is in logical order, so that it is easy to understand when read in order.</p>
