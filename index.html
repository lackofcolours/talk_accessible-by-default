							<li>have tried using a desktop screen reader like JAWs, NVDA, or OS X VoiceOver</li>

						Inclusion and access to <br><strong>information</strong> 
						and <strong>services</strong>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I love digital.govt.nz‚Äòs explanation:</p>
						<p>Web accessibility is about inclusion ‚Äî making sure everyone, including disabled people and those using assistive technologies, can access online information and services.</p>
						<p>So what this is saying, people need to be able to access and use the web. </p>
						<p>Why is it important that everyone have access? Because</p>
						<p><strong>Information</strong> leads to knowledge. Knowledge <strong>empowers</strong> to people</p>
						<p>Users with low literacy can still learn the topic, if you've used simple language</p>
						<p>What about <strong>services</strong>? Services <strong>enable users</strong> to achieve their goal</p>
						<p>Users who can't speak can use online form to do stuff without hopping on the phone</p>

						<strong>Hyper Text Markup Language</strong><br>
						ü§ç  HTML
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>How were these information and services made accessible?</p>
						<hr>
						<p>By using declarative programming languages like <strong>Hyper Text Markup Language</strong> (HTML)</p>
						<p>HTML is a way to give meaning to text content!</p>
						<p>Why is HTML accessible?</p>
						<p>Being a declarative language by nature, it was designed to be mostly backward compatible, and simpler to use for developers/content creators.</p>
						<p>It‚Äôs also standardised so any browser can interpret and render it...</p>
						<p>Yes, even your smart fridge‚Äôs browser.</p>
						<p>It might not know how to render JavaScript or even Cascading Style Sheets, but it sure knows how to render HTML.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Who‚Äôs all this work for?</p>
						<p>If you‚Äôve been listening, or have used the internet lately, that‚Äôs technically everyone.</p>
						<hr>
						<p>It IS the purpose of the web. <strong>Well coded</strong> products with HTML, CSS, and JS <strong>enable</strong> users to access web content.</p>
						<p>If the web was coded in a <strong>non-standard</strong> way, our laptops, phone, and smart toaster browser will not be able to render the content for us to consume well. </p>
						<p>It slightly <strong>disables or hinders</strong> our ability to use the web.</p>
						<p>But meaningless HTML, hiding content via CSS, and blocking JS can be especially <strong>disabling for the disabled communities</strong>.</p>

					<p span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						Permanent, temporary, situational
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When I started learning about disability, I was so scared of referring to someone as ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù. </p>
						<p>Is that an offensive way to refer to a group?</p>
						<p>But after talking to advocates, reading user stories, and watching demos, I realised no, ‚Äúdisabled people‚Äù is exactly what we should be using.</p>
						<p>It‚Äôs <strong>social model of disability</strong>, which is especially relevant when us creators create things for people to use.</p>
						<hr>
						<ul>
							<li>A <strong>blind</strong> person can be disabled from using a site that isn‚Äôt well designed for screen readers.</li>
							<li>A <strong>wheel chair rider</strong> post hip surgery can be disabled by narrow groceries self checkout.</li>
							<li>A person <strong>cooking with dirty hands</strong> could be disabled from using recipe software if it doesn‚Äôt allow for voice dictation.</li>
							<li>A person with <strong>severe ADHD</strong> was disabled from finding product information, because of heavy use of distracting looping animations in the marketing site.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In all of these usage of the term ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù, you‚Äôll notice that it‚Äôs how the technologies have been designed that <strong>disabled and barred users with different access needs from helping themselves</strong>. </p>
						<p>By not considering, or designing with these users, <strong>design stops these communities from becoming independent</strong>.</p>
						<p>It is the creators saying: <strong>The problem is with you, not the tool</strong>.</p>
						<p>Wow, what a way to create an inclusive world.</p>
						<p>It‚Äôs especially scary to think about, when anyone can become ‚Äòdisabled‚Äô at any point in their lives.</p>

						<p>No, not just Control + to zoom into different apps or documents.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</p>
						<p>The guideline is true to its 4 core principles. POUR</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Perceivable information and user interface, text and text alternative content, etc.</li>
							<li>Operable user interface and navigation, can be easily navigated using multiple types of input device. Mouse, Keyboard, voice, etc.</li>
							<li>Understandable information and user interface, clear and predictable</li>
							<li>Robust content and reliable interpretation by assistive tech and future tools</li>
						</ul>
						<p>These principles translate into almost 50 individual success criteria - checklists by W3C that measure how accessible your content is. </p>
						<p>The guidelines also come in different versions, like WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and the upcoming 3.0. You can also meet different levels of conformance in the guide, like A (minimal), AA (acceptable), and AAA (Optimal experience).</p>

						<li class="muted">Empathy workshop</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>If you‚Äôve tried to get buy-in for anything, you know it‚Äôs hard to rely on one talk, </p>
						<p>or one presentation to change hearts and minds. Especially with foriegn concepts like accessibility.</p>
						<p>If you were in that hypothetical 12 months scenario, people might buy into the timeline; by force of course. But that‚Äôs a stick, where‚Äôs the carrot? </p>
						<p>We all know that for persistent behavioural change, incentives work much better than a stick. </p>
						<p>How do we make people want to make an accessible product?</p>
						<p>I‚Äôve found that you‚Äôll need different types of presentations or workshops with the same underlying message, at a consistent interval over a period of time. </p>
						<p>Expect this to take at least 2 months.</p>
						<p>Here are a few suggestions...</p>
						<p><strong>Accessibility 101s</strong></p>
						<p>Similar to what I‚Äôve done in the first part of this talk. </p>
						<p>You need to explain who, what, why, how of accessibility and testing to give them a general idea of the concept. </p>
						<p>But beware! </p>
						<p>These won‚Äôt be the session that gets the conversation going. It‚Äôs the bare minimum why groundwork. </p>
						<p>And no, try not to do what I‚Äôm doing, and force people to sit for 45mins to listen to an intro to accessibility. </p>
						<p>I can do that because you‚Äôve willingly signed up to watch this talk. </p>
						<p>If you‚Äôre presenting it at your team‚Äôs ceremonies like a show n tell, which is usually short, split up the content. </p>
						<p>Drip feed it‚Ä¶ be patient my friends.</p>
						<p>People will come out of these sessions with a similar reaction to a presentation on why inequality exists.</p>
						<p>They may feel curious, or even sad, but still don‚Äôt feel like they can or would do anything about it. </p>
						<p>That‚Äôs fine, you‚Äôre building awareness.</p>
					</aside>

					<h2>1. Buy-in</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>Accessibility 101s</li>
						<li>User stories</li>
						<li class="muted">Empathy workshop</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>User stories</p>
						<p>These are a little bit more interesting. </p>
						<p>The goal is to move from the why behind accessibility, to who are the access needs users. </p>
						<p>Our goal for these sessions is to highlight their web content consumption strategies. </p>
						<p>When the makers know how consumers consume their stuff, they start to design with those users in mind.</p>
						<p>There are a lot of videos online which show different access needs for users like </p>
						<p>a deaf person watching a video transcript, </p>
						<p>a low vision user using high contrast mode to read an article, </p>
						<p>or a dixlexic user encountering a huge wall of text and switching to a screen reader instead.</p>
						<p>After watching each of these videos, open the floor up to discussions. </p>
						<p>Based on different types of users, match it with your current users profile, and discuss what they may use to access your product?</p>
						<p>Someone in your team is bound to know someone who‚Äôs disabled by inconsiderate designs. </p>
						<p>Hopefully, your team‚Äôs culture is safe enough for people to share these experiences. If they do, it can be quite powerful.</p>
						<p>At these sessions, you would have created empathy for more clearly defined types of users. </p>
						<p>So at this point, hopefully you can steer the conversation around the ‚Äòhow‚Äô to designing, coding and testing with these needs in mind. </p>

						<p>I personally love these.</p>
						<p>Fork out the money. </p>
						<p>Pay advocates and different types of access need users to come into the office with their personal devices, and talk to your team about how they use them to consume the web, or better, your product.</p>
						<p>Nothing spur action like seeing customers struggle with your feature. </p>
						<p>My UX friends are nodding. It‚Äôs something most of them have probably advocated for a long time.</p>

						<p>You will most likely gain a few more strong advocates in your team, hopefully with different roles. </p>

					<h2>2. Audit</h2>

					<p><strong>internal</strong> vs <strong>external</strong></p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Next focus, let‚Äôs look at exploratory audit.</p>
						<p>Like when you‚Äôre creating a pattern library or clearing out your closet, </p>
						<p>you need to take stock of the current situation. </p>
						<p>For accessibility, you do that via an audit. There are 2 options:</p>
						<p>Internal audit and External audit</p>
						<p>So, which one? Ask </p>
						<p><strong>‚ÄúWhy did we embark upon the accessibility journey?‚Äù</strong></p>
						<p>Was it from <strong>internal drive</strong>, </p>
						<p>such as someone passionate from the team, </p>
						<p>or upper management mandate? </p>
						<p>Then Internal audit. </p>
						<p>It‚Äôs also a good way to train people to read those legal like WCAG requirements.</p>
						<p>That‚Äôs when you‚Äôd go with an internal audit/</p>
						<p>Or was it <strong>external pressure</strong> to meet NZ‚Äôs legal requirement for Government agencies, </p>
						<p>and would like to be certified? </p>
						<p>Then definitely needs an external/3rd party to provide the report. </p>
						<p>Also, if your team or company lacks in-house capability and time, this would be a way to go.</p>
						<p>Regardless of your reason, external audits are always useful. </p>
						<p>They provide an impartial insight into your product. </p>
						<p>And usually, those 3rd parties are experts or real users.</p>

						<li>Blameless debrief session</li>
						<li>Get stakeholders involved</li>
						<li>What pass? What fail? How critical?</li>
						<li>Why? Access needs impacted?</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So, using the combination of tools to do your audit, you‚Äôll generate a report.</p>
						<p>It is easy to throw the final stats of </p>
						<ul>
							<li>x number of pages failing </li>
							<li>x number of criterias, </li>
						</ul>
						<p>at the team and just leave it there for them to fix. </p>
						<p>But what kind of reaction do you think the product team and management will have, </p>
						<p>if you <strong>send them a huge list of failures</strong> in an email or a work messaging app? </p>
						<p><strong>Panic and dread is all you‚Äôre going to get.</strong></p>
						<p>Those are negative emotions which cause people to become less open to learning new things. </p>
						<p>Exactly what you don‚Äôt want for the team,</p>
						<p>who are about to embark upon a steep accessibility learning curve.</p>
						<p>The key to managing that very human reaction, </p>
						<p>is organising a debrief session with the team and stakeholders. Team, because they‚Äôre doing the work. Stakeholders, so they get a sense of how much work it‚Äôs going to be.</p>
						<p>Like all good debriefs, it needs to be blameless. Stating only facts. </p>
						<p>Summarise what are the critical fails, why they fail, and perhaps what kind of access needs those failures will disable. </p>
						<p>Open the floor up to Q&A from team members. </p>
						<p>There‚Äôs no better time for those not involved in the audit process to find out about WCAG criterias. Especially ones that failed, hence relevant to their work.</p>
						<p>Alright, so we know what‚Äôs broken. </p>
						<p><strong>How do we manage all the fixes?</strong></p>

						1.3.1 info and relationships</h3>

					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
						Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>It is extremely tempting to look at the report, </p>
						<p>See this 1.3.1 Info and Relationships failure, </p>
						<p>and write that as a task or a ticket,</p>
						<p>then assign it straight to design or dev to fix. </p>
						<hr>
						<p>The problem with this approach of creating requirements, is this becomes a task to fix a specific error.</p>
						<p>Take a look at what this criteria says...</p>
						<hr>
						<p>Took me a whole week of rereading over and over to understand that "Things should be properly related in code"</p>
						<hr>
						<p>There are 100s of ways to convey relationships between information, that could be mean: </p>
						<ol>
							<li>Ensuring that content under heading 2 actually belongs to that section of content</li>
							<li>Ensure label for=‚Äù‚Äù and input id are the same, so that screen readers know which label describes which input field</li>
							<li>Ensure that decorative image doesn‚Äôt get read out by screen readers</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Related list items just looks visually like a list, but is not marked up as ol or ul</p>
						<p>Which means that the failure may have come from 10 problems on the same page, </p>
						<p>or that one problem failed multiple other criterias. </p>
						<p>WCAG success criteria and the fix is not a 1-1 relationship. </p>
						<p>That‚Äôs a lot of redundant and duplicate admin work to create these types of error based tasks. </p>
						<p>Some, only to be closed as soon as the first one went live, since it did fix 5 criterias. </p>
						<p>Or some, taking so long to fix due to multiple problems causing that one criteria to fail. </p>
						<p>Not Agile at all.</p>

					<h2>3. Requirements - <br>User story</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>User goal</li>
						<li>Impacted user (their access needs)</li>
						<li>What does best UX look like?</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>My personal recommendation is to write them as user stories. </p>
						<p>When writing a story, look at the failed criteria, and visualise how these criteria help users with different types of access needs. Useful questions to ask:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>What task is a user supposed to be able to accomplish in this page/component?</li>
							<li>Which type of user are we disabling, if this failed WCAG/issue is not fixed?</li>
							<li>What kind of strategy/tools would these users use to consume content?</li>
							<li>What do we need to do to serve those users the best possible user experience?
								<ul>
									<li>What could go wrong?</li>
									<li>Who could we be excluding?</li>
									<li>How could this be misused?</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Based on those answers, write tasks up as user stories. </p>
						<p>This will give the team more information and guidance when looking for an appropriate solution and narrow down testing methods. </p>
						<p>This makes it much easier for the team to deal with issues, and chip away at the errors.</p>

						<p>How did we decide what to give 10% support? </p>
						<p>Most sold devices on the market, and top 95% of your product‚Äôs Google Analytics viewport stats.</p>
						<p>Though we can‚Äôt rely on Google Analytics for assistive tech usage stats yet, </p>
						<hr>
						<p>we can look at WebAIM‚Äôs annual surveys in conjunction with stats from your local accessibility advocates. What is your local charity for different types of disabilities training their patrons to use? </p>

						<p>Next is screen reader training</p>
						<p>My friends, welcome, to a whole new world. </p>
						<p>We‚Äôre going to have to start learning how to use only the keyboard to navigate, and how to use screen readers. It‚Äôs actually quite fun. Keep an open mind.</p>
						<p>Why do we need to learn this? Wouldn‚Äôt clear headings and well designed content be enough?</p>
						<p>Using a screen reader is a different experience. </p>
						<p>A content first one.</p>
						<p>So knowing how screen readers work will help you test your product as you develop. </p>
						<p>Rather than waiting until the end stage usability testing to reveal where you went wrong. </p>
						<p>Helps you be Agile!</p>
						<p>My tip here is, that have every role in the team learn it.</p>
						<p>BA, design, devs, and QAs. </p>
						<p>Including other stakeholders might be a stretch. </p>
						<p>But if you have the influence, do try.</p>

						<p>Divide and conquer. </p>
						<p>Remember when I said that you should be gaining some accessibility champions after user stories or empathy workshop sessions? </p>

						<p>Not all screen readers work the same way. </p>
						<p>Think iPhone vs Android. Or Mac vs PC. They‚Äôre all computers. But they‚Äôre slightly different.</p>
						<p>Even the OS X and iOS version of VoiceOver by apple is different.</p>
						<p>I‚Äôm on a Mac, so the natural screen reader to pick up is OS X VoiceOver (comes pre installed). </p>
						<p>If you‚Äôre on a PC, NVDA is free, pick that up. </p>
						<p>If your core user base is phones, iOS VoiceOver and Android Talkback will be what you should learn.</p>
						<p>Learning these are especially interesting, because your smartphone is a flat piece of glass with almost no buttons. </p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So, like all product journeys, it start with design.</p>
						<p>For a lot of designers, their questions around accessibility could be any, or all of these:</p>
						<hr>
						<ul>
							<li>Do I need to do anything if people are not navigating the product by sight?</li>

						<p>It‚Äôs fear of the unknown.</p>
						<p>They might even be going through a design existential crisis. It‚Äôs ok.</p>
						<p>Give them a hug, a hot beverage and some food. Tell them that you‚Äôre all in this new journey together.</p>

					<h2>6. Testing &amp; development</h2>

					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>Isn‚Äôt the design system already accessible?</li>
						<li>I don‚Äôt get HTML &amp; CSS!</li>
						<li>Who tests what?</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Now, let‚Äôs have a look at concerns around testing and development</p>
						<p>If your product is using a pattern library or a design system, </p>
						<p>check if it‚Äôs accessible out of the box</p>
						<p>If no, talk to the creators. It might be the kind of feedback they‚Äôre looking for.</p>
						<p>If it is accessible, check your implementation. Have you added in all the attributes they recommended?</p>
						<p>Design systems are just a base for you to build experiences.</p>
						<p>It‚Äôs your team and designer who put together the experience.</p>
						<p>Try navigating through with only keyboard, then with screen readers.</p>
						<p>If you haven‚Äôt already from the audit phase, integrate those automated tests to help monitor implementation.</p>
						<p>While you‚Äôre doing all this, be mindful that</p>
						<p>Not all developers are UI focused front end developers. </p>
						<p>HTML & CSS isn‚Äôt usually taught in comp sci degrees. And it‚Äôs hardly a focus in bootcamps.</p>
						<p>These days, pattern libraries make it easier than ever for devs to make a designed looking page without ever touching HTML and CSS. </p>
						<p>So by needing to really look under the hood of these UI tools, they might be learning a whole new language, and could be experiencing imposter syndrome. </p>
						<p>Please don‚Äôt go saying that HTML and CSS is basic. Hold their hands, and connect them with a kind front end dev.</p>
						<p>And think back to testing early days of responsive design.</p>
						<p>Both you and QAs were probably trying to test as many devices as you can in the beginning. Cause nothing was responsive</p>
						<p>And later on, you know and have fixed enough to get a sense of what you need to specifically test in each phase.</p>
						<p>As you and your QA gain more experience, it‚Äôs likely that devs will test on their preferred assistive tool, and QA run regression on the rest when it‚Äôs a new feature. </p>
						<p>So it‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs only a lot of work in the beginning.</p>

						<p>No honey</p>
						<hr>
						<p>I know I wasn‚Äôt saying good things about usability testing before.</p>
						<p>My problem was with mass testing, </p>
						<p>just to generally check if you‚Äôre accessible, </p>
						<p>and before your team learn about what accessibility is.</p>
						<p>At this point, your team knows the work involved. You‚Äôve up-skilled</p>
						<p>This time the usability testing goal is to check the gaps in your knowledge, and figure out other ways to improve.</p>

					<h2>Team needs</h2>

						<p>I‚Äôve spent 40+ minutes arming you with what a systematic cultural shift would look like, and what you‚Äôd expect to happen in each stage. </p>
						<p>The last 2 phases will probably take at least <strong>4-5 months</strong> fo teams to adjust.</p>
						<p>That was a lot of content which you won‚Äôt remember.</p>
						<p>But really, it all boils down to making the team think more deeply about different user needs,</p>
						<p>Empathise and be curious about their experiences. </p>
						<p>It‚Äôll help inform what you need to do</p>
						<p>Be patient with your team‚Äôs learning progress, </p>
						<p>don‚Äôt beat yourself up when you hit another constraint or criteria, </p>
						<p>but celebrate new learnings when you do.</p>
						<p>Be consistent with your accessibility practice. </p>
						<p>And keep at it until it become your team‚Äôs habit.</p>
						<p>The last step though, is to include disabled people in your team, to truly be able to design inclusive experiences.</p>
						<p>That‚Äôs how you‚Äôll become accessible by default</p>
